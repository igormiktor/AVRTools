 * \brief This is an abstract class defining a generic interface to write numbers and strings to a sequential
 * stream of bytes (such as a serial output device).
 *
 * It implements functions to convert various integers
 * and floating point numbers into a sequence of bytes (so it is not a pure interface class).  These functions depend on a small
 * set of lower-level functions that are purely abstract and must be implemented by classes deriving from
 * Writer.
 *
 * Serial0 is an example of a class that derives from Writer by implementating the purely
 * abstract functions in Writer.
