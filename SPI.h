 * \brief This namespace bundles an interface to the %SPI hardware subsystem on the AVR ATMega328p (Arduino Uno)
 * and ATMega2560 (Arduino Mega) microcontrollers.  It provides logical cohesion for functions implement the
 * Master portion of the %SPI protocol and prevents namespace collisions.
 *
 * These interfaces are synchronous, based on polling the flag in the %SPI status register to determine
 * transmission is complete and refill the transmit register with data.
 * While it is possible to create an interrupt driven, asynchronous
 * interface to the %SPI subsystem, %SPI-based communications are so fast that interrupt-based implementations are
 * slower than polling by nearly a factor of 2.  This is based on actual testing data which you can review
 * [here] (https://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2012/06/spi_interrupts_versus_polling/). What happens is that
 * %SPI can work at half the CPU frequency, which means the CPU can only execute about 16 instructions per
 * byte sent.  When the CPU is calling interrupts that often, the overhead of calling the interrupt function dominates,
 * and is greater than the overhead of a simple polling loop.
 *
 * The AVRTools implementation is based in part on the Arduino Library %SPI module.  In particular, the
 * SPISettings class from the Arduino library is very cleverly and efficiently coded and has been adopted here.
 * The lessons learned by the Arduino library %SPI authors in correctly initializing the %SPI subsystem have
 * also been incorporated into this implementation.  However, the packaging of the interface is somewhat different
 * the AVRTools implementation takes a different approach to deconflicting %SPI usage between the main thread of
 * code execution and interrupt code.
 *
 * The fundamental problem is this:  if %SPI is used in both the main code and in interrupt code, then it is
 * important to ensure that the %SPI "transactions" not be interleaved, that only one %SPI "transaction" happen
 * at a time.  More specifically, you have to ensure that interrupt code using %SPI does not interrupt an
 * on-going %SPI transaction in the main thread.  The Arduino library achieves this by requiring library
 * users to register any interrupts that use %SPI and then requirng users to formally define (via function calls)
 * the beginning and end of an %SPI "transaction".  The AVRTools library instead
 * provides tools (via the InterruptUtils module) to temporarily suppress selected interrupts while the main thread
 * is executing an %SPI transaction.  This approach allows more fine-tuned control of interrupt suppression,
 * automatically restores interrupts when the %SPI transaction is complete (no risk of a missing
 * "end-of-transaction"), and does it with less overhead and memory footprint than the Arduino %SPI library.  The
 * following code snippet illustrates how to protect main thread %SPI usage from conflicts with %SPI usage by
 * two external interrupt handlers:
 *
 * ~~~{.cpp}
 * uint8_t send( uint8_t data )
 * {
 *   // SPI is used by the interrupt functions that respond to external interrupts 0 and 1,
 *   // so to prevent clashes, we suppress these two external interrupts for
 *   // the duration of this function
 *   Interrupts::ExternalOff interruptsOff( kExternalInterrupt0 | kExternalInterrupt1 );
 *
 *   // Configure SPI
 *   SPI::configure( SPISettings( 4000000, SPI::kLsbFirst, SPI::kSpiMode2 ) );
 *
 *   // Set the remote slave SS pin low to initiate a transmission
 *   setGpioPinLow( pConnectedToSlaveSSpin );
 *
 *   // Transmit
 *   uint8_t retVal = SPI::transmit( data );
 *
 *   // Set the remote slave SS pin high to terminate the transmission
 *   setGpioPinLow( pConnectedToSlaveSSpin );
 *
 *   // Interrupts automatically reset when this function exits
 *   return retVal;
 * }
 * ~~~
 *
 *
 * \note This module implements %SPI master mode only.
