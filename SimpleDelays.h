 * \brief This file provides simple delay functions that do not involve
 * timers or interrupts.  These functions simply execute a series of
 * nested loops with known and precise timing.
 *
 * For precision, these functions are all implemented directly in assembler.
 *
 * \note These functions are implemented for (and automatically adjust to) either
 * an 8 MHz or a 16 MHz clock cycle.

/*!
 * \brief Delay a given number of quarter microseconds.  Due to function call
 * overhead, at 16 MHz the smallest possible delay is just under 6 quarter microseconds (~1.5 microseconds).
 * Delays of 7 quarter microseconds or greater are reasonably accurate.  At 8 MHz the
 * smallest possible delay is just under 12 quarter microseconds (~3 microseconds).  Delays of
 * 13 quarter microseconds or greater are reasonably accurate
 *
 * At 16 MHz delays of less than 7 quarter microseconds produce a delay of just under
 * 6 quarter microseconds (~1.5 microseconds). At 8 MHz delays of less than 12 quarter
 * microseconds produce a delay of just under 12 quarter microseconds (~3 microseconds).
 *
 * The maximum delay is 65535 quarter microseconds (equal to 16,383.75 microseconds, or
 * about 16.4 milliseconds).
 *
 * \arg \c nbrOfQuartersOfMicroSeconds the number of quarter microseconds to delay.
 * For 16 MHz clocks, arguments less than 7 quarter microseconds for 16 MHz clocks
 * all produce delays of just under 6 quarter microseconds.  For 8 MHz clocks,
 * arguments less than 13 quarter microseconds all produce delays of about
 * 12 quarter microseconds.
 *
 * \note This delay function is only accurate if interrupts are disabled.  If interrupts
 * are enabled, the delays will be at least as long as requested, but may actually be
 * longer.  If accurate delays are desired, disable interrupts before calling this
 * function (remember to enable interrupts afterwards).
 *
 * \note This function only works for CPU clocks running at either 8 MHz or 16 MHz.
 *
 * For precision, this function is implemented directly in assembler.
