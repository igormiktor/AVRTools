 * \brief This file provides \c operator \c new and \c operator \c delete.  You
 * only need this file if you use \c new and \c delete to manage objects on the heap.
 *
 * If you do use \c new and \c delete, then include new.h in your source files
 * and link your project against new.cpp.
 *
 * \note The AVRTools library does not itself make any use of heap storage
 * or the `new` or `delete` operators.
